My name is Heng Jin En with matrix number, 22004872. I am
majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
subject. This is because this subject can improve my algorithm skills which can
use the most suitable data structures without wasting memory spaces.

I acquired B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will follow every instructions that Mr Hoo ask me to do and extra research when free.
Wish me luck!!!
