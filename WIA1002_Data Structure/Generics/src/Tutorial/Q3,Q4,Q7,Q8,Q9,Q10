Q3
What is a raw type?

a generic class/ interface used without a type parameter

eg. ArrayList arrayList = new ArrayList()

Why is a raw type unsafe?

- bypass generic type checks
- deferring the catch of unsafe code to runtime

Why is the raw type allowed in Java?

- only as a concession to compatibility of legacy code
- show up in legacy code because lots of API classes
(such as the Collections classes) were not generic prior to JDK 5.0

Q4
What is erasure?

a process which Java compiler erases all generic type
information from the compiled version of a program that uses generics


Why are Java generics implements using erasure?

to ensure the backward compatibility with pre generics code
